# habit-tracker-api

(Name subject to change, maybe it's the spiritual successor to Ginko)

This is the API for my habit tracking app.
The app will eventually track a set of defined habits, remind the user to do
and track them, and then present a user-defined reward for an accumulation
of days sticking to the habit.
